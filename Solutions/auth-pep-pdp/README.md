# Solution - PEP and PDP with Cognito User Pools

![Cover Image.](images/cover-image.png)

## Cost

As this solution is 100% serverless the cost for building and running this tutorial is very low and the cost has a direct correlation to usage. There are no components that cost by the hour, you only pay for what you use / invoke.

## Before you start

The following need to be available on your computer:

* [Install SAM Cli](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/serverless-application-model/latest/developerguide/install-sam-cli.html)

Now, Let's go build!

## Introduction

In this solution we will implement PDP (Policy Decision Point) and a PEP (Policy Enforcement Point). We will build an simple API and use Amazon API Gateway and Lambda Authorizer as the PEP.

For authentication Cognito User Pools will be used. The PDP can be implemented in two different ways, in both we will implement it as a separate Lambda based service.

In the first solution we will use Role Based Access Control (RBAC) and the PDP will keep an mapping between Roles (Cognito Groups) and permissions / access to resources, in DynamoDB.

In the second solution we will also use Role Based Access Control (RBAC), but the PDP will use Amazon Verified Permissions (AVP) to evaluate access and permissions using Roles (Cognito Groups).

The managed UI will be used for Cognito authentication.

For deep dive into this solution read the two existing blogs on the topic.

### Cognito callbacks

As we utilize Cognito Managed UI we need to configure some form of webapp that we can set as the callback targets for Cognito. Here we will base this of the solution [Authorization using Lambda@Edge](https://github.com/JimmyDqv/serverless-handbook/tree/main/Solutions/auth-at-cloudfront-edge)

## Deploying the solution

### How to deploy

This solution will deploy resources in two regions, eu-west-1 as our main region, and us-east-1 for resources that belong to CloudFront, such as the Lambda@Edge functions and SSL certificate.

Before you start, you will need a custom domain that can be used, through out `dashboard.example.com` will be used, this need to be changed to a custom domain you own.

### Deploy User Management (UserPool)

Start by updating [UserManagement/samconfig.yaml](UserManagement/samconfig.yaml) and add your own custom domain.
Deploy using the SAM CLI:

``` bash
sam deploy --config-env default --template-file UserManagement/template.yaml 
```

### Deploy Lambda@Edge functions

Update [Lambda@Edge/samconfig.yaml](Lambda@Edge/samconfig.yaml) and update values:

* DomainName = Shall be your own custom domain, same as for User Management
* HostedZoneId = Is the id of your Hosted Zone in Route53
* SecretArn = Is the ARN to the secret in Secrets Manager containing User Pool Client secrets, ARN can be found in output section from UserManagement stack
* SsmParametersArn = Is the wildcard ARN for the parameters in Parameter Store that contain information about UserManagement setup, arn:aws:ssm:eu-west-1:<your-account-id>:parameter/pep-pdp-cognito/*

Deploy using the SAM CLI:

``` bash
sam build
sam deploy --config-env default --template-file Lambda@Edge/template.yaml
```

NOTE! That this stack will deploy in `us-east-1` region

### Update secrets

Update the secrets needed by the Lambda@Edge functions.

Navigate to Cognito part of the console, click on your UserPool -> App Clients -> Your app Client.
![Image showing the client secrets](images/client-secrets.png)

Navigate to SecretsManager in the console, open your secret, click get secret value and edit the values, with the values from Cognito
![Image showing update of client secrets](images/update-secrets.png)

### Deploy SSL Certificate

Update [SSLCertificate/samconfig.yaml](SSLCertificate/samconfig.yaml) and add your own custom domain.

Deploy using the SAM CLI:

``` bash
sam deploy --config-env default --template-file Lambda@Edge/template.yaml
```

NOTE! That this stack will deploy in `us-east-1` region

### Deploy CloudFront Distribution

Update [CloudFrontDistribution/samconfig.yaml](CloudFrontDistribution/samconfig.yaml) and update values:

* DomainName = Shall be your own custom domain, same as for User Management
* Function ARNs = Fetch the ARNs from the Lambda@Edge stack, ensure that the version is added to the end of each ARN, e.g. `:1`

Deploy using the SAM CLI:

``` bash
sam deploy --config-env default --template-file CloudFrontDistribution/template.yaml
```

Copy the simple web page to S3 bucket:

``` bash
aws s3 cp index.html s3://<bucket-name-from-distribution>/index.html
```

### Deploy DynamoDB based Authorization (PDP)

Check the values in [AuthService/samconfig.yaml](AuthService/samconfig.yaml) and ensure they match:

Deploy using the SAM CLI:

``` bash
sam build
sam deploy --config-env default --template-file AuthService/template.yaml
```

### Deploy AVP based Authorization (PDP)

Check the values in [AuthServiceAVP/samconfig.yaml](AuthServiceAVP/samconfig.yaml) and ensure they match:

Deploy using the SAM CLI:

``` bash
sam build
sam deploy --config-env default --template-file AuthServiceAVP/template.yaml
```

### Deploy API

Check the values in [API/samconfig.yaml](API/samconfig.yaml) make sure you set the `PDPStackName` to point to the stack for either the DynamoDB based PDP or the AVP based PDP.

Deploy using the SAM CLI:

``` bash
sam build
sam deploy --config-env default --template-file API/template.yaml
```

## Test the setup

To test the PEP and PDP create a User, Roles, and depending on solution Permission mapping.

### Create User

Navigate to the Cognito UserPool in the Console, click on Users and click `Create User`.
![Image showing cognito userpool](images/create-user.png)

Fill in the values needed, username, password, e-mail make sure to select that the e-mail is verified
![Image showing create user](images/create-user-details.png)

Open a browser and navigate to you custom domain, you should get redirected to Cognito UI, after successful login, click `Show Cookies` to show the JWT tokens.

### Create Roles

Navigate to the Cognito UserPool in the Console, click on Groups and click `Create Group`.
Create at least one Group that can match a Role, e.g. `Admin`, `Trainer`, `Rider`
![Image showing cognito userpool groups](images/create-groups.png)

### Assign Role to user

Stay in the Groups section of Cognito UserPool, and click one of the Groups just created.
Click on `Add user to group` and select the created user.

### Add dataAccess attribute to user (ABAC only)

Lorem Ipsum

### Create Permission mapping (DynamoDB based PDP only)

navigate to DynamoDB section of the Console. Locate the permissions table and click on that.
![Image showing DynamoDB tables](images/dynamodb-tables.png)

Click on `Explore table items` in the right corner.
![Image showing the DynamoDB table](images/dynamodb-table-details.png)

From this view click on `Creat item`
![Image showing DynamoDB items](images/dynamodb-table-explore-items.png)

Create a permission mapping, by adding one or several Role - Permission mapping as below.
![Image showing cognito userpool group users](images/dynamodb-table-create-item.png)

The solution support explicit `Allow`, implicit and explicit `Deny`. Make sure to add at least one allow for the Role assigned to the test user.

### Explore AVP policies (AVP based PDP only)

To explore and test the setup of AVP we can navigate to the AVP part of the console.

Under Policy Stores you should see the policy store that was created for our PDP.

![Image showing the policy store list ](images/policy-stores.png)

By clicking on the ID of the policy store and selecting `Policies` in the menu we see the list of the three created policies.

![Image showing the policy list ](images/policies.png)

By selecting the Riders policy we can now inspect the create policy.

![Image showing the policy list ](images/policy-content.png)

By selecting `Schema` in the menu we can inspect the created schema in a visual form.

![Image showing the policy schema ](images/policy-schema.png)

![Image showing the policy schema ](images/schema-entity-actions.png)

Now, we can navigate to the `Test Bench` to test out our policies, fill in the information as shown in the image below. The group must be prefixed with the Cognito User Pool Id and follow pattern `<COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID>|<GROUP_NAME>`

![Image showing the test bench ](images/test-bench-setup.png)

If we select the action `/get trainers` and click `Run Authorization request` we should get a deny back, as the `Trainer` role don't have access to that `Action`

![Image showing the test bench ](images/test-bench-deny.png)

Swapping to the `/get trainer` action should instead give us an allow back.

![Image showing the test bench ](images/test-bench-allow.png)

### Call API

Navigate to you favorite API tool such as Postman, Bruno or similar. Make a request to one of the API resources that the test user is `Allow` to view. Make sure to add the `access token` in the `authorization` header. Observe that a correct result is returned.
![Image showing can allowed request](images/test-allowed.png)

Next make an API call to one of the API resources that the test user doesn't have access to. Observe that a 403 result is returned.

## Clean up

To clean everything up delete the CloudFormation stack. This can be done either with SAM Cli command

``` bash
sam delete --stack-name TEXT
```

Or from the [AWS Console](https://eu-west-1.console.aws.amazon.com/cloudformation/home?region=eu-north-1#/stacks)
